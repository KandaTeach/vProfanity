vProfanity is a software solution that automates the detection and censorship of profanity words and sexual material in video content.

vProfanity uses machine learning models, specifically speech recognition and image classification.

## Why vProfanity was Built

In modern teaching, teachers frequently use digital multimedia files as teaching aids during classes. Digital video is one of the most frequently used teaching aids among other multimedia files because students can interact more through watching videos. Teachers access and download these videos from different video sharing platforms, which allow such content as long as it is educational, documentary, scientific, or creative, and not unreasonable. However, teachers cannot provide these videos to students because they are underage and not appropriate for them to watch. In order to avoid these content, teachers manually review and remove profane words and sexual material present in the videos, which is labor-intensive, time-consuming, tedious, and not very efficient. Automating the process would lessen the tedious task of removing profanity words and sexual material in every video.

## What Exactly is vProfanity
